## 📝 Research Protocol (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

Before ANY trade:

```
1. WHAT is being decided?
   → Read market question

2. ARE CRITERIA CLEAR?
   → Check resolution criteria
   → If unclear = DON'T TRADE

3. WHAT'S THE PRICE?
   → Current probability
   → Volume

4. IS IT IN 10-90% RANGE?
   → <10% = Long Shot = NO
   → >90% = Too obvious = maybe

5. WHAT'S THE EDGE?
   → Compare to market consensus
   → Do I have info the market doesn't?

6. THESIS:
   → Write specific reasoning
   → "Because [fact 1] and [fact 2], I think [outcome]"
```
